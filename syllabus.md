## Course description

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions be related to the state? Students in this class
will take up these two questions through the historical analysis of
texts about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon,
and Native American religions with one another and with the federal and
state governments. They will investigate how law has regulated the
public sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take
place, but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We
will trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of diversity
in eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first
century. Students will write three essays: one expositing a document
about a religious conflict, a second interacting with other historians'
interpretations, and a third based on original research into religious
conflict.
