% Religious Pluralism and the American State
% Lincoln A. Mullen

### Course description

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions relate to the state? In this class you will
take up these two questions through the historical analysis of texts
about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and
Native American religions with one another and with the federal and
state governments. You will investigate how law has regulated the public
sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take place,
but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We will
trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of diversity in
eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first century.
Because this is a writing seminar, you will write three essays: one
expositing a document about a religious conflict, a second interacting
with other historians' interpretations, and a third based on original
research into religious conflict.

## Learning goals

After taking this course, you will be able to

+   write argumentative essays based on your reading in primary and
    secondary sources,
+   explain the history of religious pluralism and religious liberty in
    the United States, and
+   interpret primary sources as a historian and evaluate the
    interpretations of secondary works.

## The intellectual work of the course

The intellectual work of this course is centered on understanding the
problem of religious pluralism and religious liberty as it relates to
the American state. You will engage that intellectual problem in two
ways. First, you will *read* documents throughout American history
written by people who worked through the questions of religious liberty
and religious pluralism, and you will read the works of historians.
Second, you will *write* your own interpretative essays grounded in your
reading of primary and secondary sources. Specifically, you will
complete three major writing assignments and accompanying pre-draft
assignments:

1. a close-reading essay, a 5--6 page essay interpreting a historical
   text;

2. a lens essay, a 7--8 page essay applying and engaging with a
   historian's argument about primary texts; and

3. a research essay, a 10 page essay based on your own research into
   primary and secondary texts.

You will also complete a number of other requirements, including a
portfolio, three conferences with me, peer-review workshops, and
practice writing assignments in-class or online (which will count
towards your participation grade).
