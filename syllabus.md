## Course description

Two of the most pressing questions about American religion and its
public role are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another,
and how should religions be related to the state? Students in this class
will take up these two questions through the historical analysis of
texts about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon,
and Native American religions with one another and with the federal and
state governments. They will investigate how law has regulated the
public sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take
place, but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We
will trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of diversity
in eighteenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first
century. Students will write three essays: one expositing a document
about a religious conflict, a second interacting with other historians'
interpretations, and a third based on original research into religious
conflict.

## Learning goals

After taking this course, you will be able to

+   write argumentative essays based on your reading in primary and
    secondary sources,
+   revise your own writing,
+   explain the history of religious pluralism and religious liberty in
    the United States,
+   read and interpret a primary source as a historian, and
+   understand and evaluate the arguments and interpretations of a work
    of history.

## Texts

You will read a number of primary sources, which will be available in a
course pack or on the website. You can purchase the course pack
at cost in class, and it will be available on the website as well.

## The intellectual work of the course

The intellectual work of this course is centered on understanding the
problem of religious pluralism and religious liberty as it relates to
the American state. You will engage that intellectual problem in two
ways. 

First, you will *read* documents throughout American history
written by people who worked through the questions of religious liberty
and religious pluralism. You will also read the works of
historians who have read the same documents and who offer 
interpretations of the past.

Second, you will *write* your own interpretative essays grounded in your
reading of primary and secondary sources. Specifically, you will
complete three major writing assignments and accompanying pre-draft
assignments:

1. a close-reading essay, a 5--6 page essay interpreting a historical
   text;

2. a lens essay, a 7--8 page essay applying and engaging with a
   historian's argument about primary texts; and

3. a research essay, a 10 page essay based on your own research into
   primary and secondary texts.

You will also complete a number of other requirements:

+   a portfolio, which collects your work for the course into one
    package, for you to assess how you have developed as a writer;

+   three 20-minute conferences with me, one for each of your essays;

+   peer-review workshops, where you will help your colleagues in the
    class develop their writing; and

+   a number of practice writing assignments in-class or online (which
    will count towards your participation grade).

I will give you detailed instruction and help with all assignments in
class and in handouts.
