We have read a letter from the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island,
to President George Washington and his response. 

Write a short, six to seven paragraph essay explaining the ideas in the
documents. You might consider any one or more of the following
questions:

#.  What are the key terms in both letters? Which do they share?
#.  What ideas of religious liberty do these documents express?
#.  What allusions do the synagogue and Washington make in their
    letters? What do these allusions mean, or what work do they do?
#.  What exactly is the synagogue asking for? Does Washington grant
    their request? How do you know?
#.  What accounts for the similarity in wording between the two letters?

You should use quotations from the two letters as evidence in your
essay.
