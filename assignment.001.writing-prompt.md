% Writing Prompt

We have read a letter from the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island,
to President George Washington and his response. Write a short, six to
seven paragraph essay answering this question: What are the main ideas
of religious liberty expressed by Washington and the Newport Jews? How
would you respond to these ideas?

You should use quotations from the two letters as evidence in your
essay. You might consider writing paragraphs on some of the following
questions.

1.  What are the key terms in both letters? Which do they share?
2.  What exactly is the synagogue asking for? Does Washington grant
    their request? How do you know?
3.  What accounts for the similarity in wording between the two letters?
4.  What kinds of religions should receive religious liberty?
5.  What role does the state have in providing religious liberty?

This assignment is ungraded. What you write will let me know where
everyone is beginning in thinking about the history of religious
pluralism and the state.
