# Religions, Pluralism, and the American State #

Two of the most pressing questions about religion and its public role
are intertwined: how should religions relate to one another, and how
should religions be related to the state? Students in this class will
take up these two questions through the historical analysis of texts
about the interactions of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, and
Native American faiths with one another and with the federal and state
governments. They will investigate how law has regulated the public
sphere and the civil square in which religious interactions take place,
but also how religious actors have driven those interactions. We will
trace the history of American pluralism, from the fact of pluralism
in seventeenth century to the idea of pluralism in the twenty-first
century.
